# FaceRecognition
Facial Recognition using zero shot and few shot learning.

Progress:
    1. Initially created custom datasets using the image data and the pairs txt files. 
    2. Tried using a siamese network with contrasive loss and a siamese network with add on feed forward network to classify whether the images are same or not. The model seems to be not learning anything at all and is just randomly predicting. 
    3. Will be now trying out simple problem statement of classifying images to persons for persons with more than hundred images
